### Hi :wave:, I’m Frank Shanahan.

Thanks for checking out my data analytics portfolio! 

I've included some past work while studying Data Analytics at Santa Clara University and work I'm currently focused on to advance my skills. Most of the projects I've done are in Python and R because of the comprehensive advanced statistic, data visualization, and ML functionality. When it comes to SQL, I've created an entire RDBMS for a sports memorabilia company that utlized many of the key SQL commands. I have various projects posted here and will be posting more as time allows. Please take a look and let me know what you think.
       

As for details about me :raising_hand_man: 

At the moment, I'm very excited to be making a career transition into Data Analytics!! Having spent 10+ years in various sales functions within the same industries, I'm ready to take on new challenge. I'm ecstatic to join a team, build on a solid foundation of coding skills and statistics, and make an impact in a new industry.

- :bar_chart: I’m currently brushing up on my advanced Excel skills & learning Tableau
- :family_man_woman_boy_boy: My wife, Tessa, and I have two cute soccer-loving boys (Madden 6 & Rory 3).

- :runner: I'm big on running. I like to swim, bicycle, play frisbee golf, hike...but running is a constant in my exercise routine. 
- :rofl: Fun Fact: When I was 12 I placed 3rd in a single ski slalom competition. Little known fact; there were 3 people in my age bracket. :laughing:
