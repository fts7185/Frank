### Hi 👋, I’m Frank Shanahan.

Thanks for checking out my data analytics portfolio! 

I've included a bit of my past work from when I completed MBA with a specilization in Data Analytics while at Santa Clara Univ. and work that I'm currently focused on to further my skills. Most of the projects I've done are in Python and R because of the comprehensive advanced statistic, data visualization and ML functionality. When it comes to SQL, I've created an entire ER Schema and RDBMS for a sports memorabilia company. I have various projects posted here and will be posting more as time allows. Please take a look and let me know what you think.
       
As for details about me:

At the moment, I'm ecstatic to be making a career transition into Data Analytics!! Having been in various sales roles within my current industry for 10+ years, I'm ready to take on new challenges, build on a solid foundation of coding skills and contribute to a team however I can help out. Here are a few additional details:

- 👀 I’m interested in transitioning my career into the data analytics field.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Tableau
- 💞️ I’m looking to show off my portfolio of work in SQL, Python and R.
