### 👋 Hi, I’m Frank Shanahan
       Thanks for checking out my data analytics portfolio! It's a bit of work from when I completed my data analytics specalization during grad school and work I'm currently focused on to further my skills. Most of the work I've done was in Python and R because of the ML and advanced statistic functions (linear regressions, etc.). With the help of one peer, we created an entire ER Schema and DB for a sports memorabilia company via SQL. I have various projects posted here and will be posting more as I can. Please take a look and let me know what you think. 
       
       As for details about me:
       
- 👀 I’m interested in transitioning my career into the data analytics field.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Tableau
- 💞️ I’m looking to show off my portfolio of work in SQL, Python and R.
