### Hi :wave:, I’m Frank Shanahan.

Thanks for checking out my data analytics portfolio! 

I've included a bit of my past work from when I completed my MBA with a specialization in Data Analytics while at Santa Clara Univ. and work that I'm currently focused on to further my skills. Most of the projects I've done are in Python and R because of the comprehensive advanced statistic, data visualization, and ML functionality. When it comes to SQL, I've created an entire ER Schema and RDBMS for a sports memorabilia company. I have various projects posted here and will be posting more as time allows. Please take a look and let me know what you think.
       
As for details about me:

At the moment, I'm ecstatic to be making a career transition into Data Analytics!! Having been in various sales roles within my current industry for 10+ years, I'm ready to take on new challenges, build on a solid foundation of coding skills and contribute to a team however I can help out. Here are a few additional details:

- :eyes: I’m interested in transitioning my career into the data analytics field.
- :bar_chart: I’m currently brushing up on my advanced Excel skills & learning Tableau
- :family_man_woman_boy_boy: My wife, Tessa, and I have two cute soccer-loving boys (Madden 6 & Rory 3). 
- :man_cook: All of 2021 I ran a small weekend bakery specializing in artisan bread & English Muffins.
- :runner: I'm big on running. I like to swim, bicycle, play frisbee golf, hike...but running is a constant in my exercise routine. 
- :rofl: Fun Fact: When I was 12 I placed 3rd in a single ski slalom competition. Little known fact; there were 3 people in my age bracket. :laughing: 
- :envelope_with_arrow: How to reach me fts7185@gmail.com.
